# NIH Command Language - Library

This is the library implementing NIH Command Language. `ncl` is designed to
be a command language allowing to drive command driven applications.  Among
the existing languages, `tcl` is probably the closer in design goals. `lua`
shares also some characteristics but seems to be designed more for
scripting than for interactive use.

[`nclsh`](http://www.github.com/nhamblenne/nclsh) is a standalone
executable for interpreting the `ncl` language.

## Status

The language is in its design phase. The available part of the
documentation is on the
[wiki](http://www.github.com/nhamblenne/libncl/wiki).
